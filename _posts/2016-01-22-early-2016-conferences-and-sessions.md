Well it looks like my relaxing break from speaking and attending conferences is quickly coming to and end.  On the one hand I am excited to get back to the &#8220;conference circuit&#8221; on the other I enjoyed being able to stay home and get a ton of stuff done  <img src="http://ryanjbaxter.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Over the next few weeks I will speaking at several events, so if you are attending any of these conferences be sure to stop by say hi and see whats new with Bluemix!

This was one of my favorite conferences from last year and I excited to not only be speaking again but giving 2 sessions this year.  Links to the sessions are below.

## <a href="http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/interconnect/" target="_blank">IBM InterConnect Feb 21st -25th</a>

IBM InterConnect has become IBM&#8217;s premier conference with topics that include Cloud, IoT, Watson, Mobile, Security, and much much more.  Last year there were 20,000+ attendees.  I really enjoyed the conference and am looking forward to attending again.  I will be giving a <a href="https://www-950.ibm.com/events/global/interconnect/sessions/preview.html?sessionid=IDA-6754" target="_blank">15 minute lightening talk on MQTT</a> in the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/interconnect/devat/" target="_blank">dev@ track</a>.  The dev@ track looks like it is shaping up to be a nice mini conference just for developers.  All technical topics, no sales or marketing.  If your the technical type attending Interconnect I suggest you spend some time in the dev@ tack.
