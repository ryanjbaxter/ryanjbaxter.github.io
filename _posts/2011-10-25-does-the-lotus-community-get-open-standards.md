_What is ActivityStreams?_

_What is OAuth?_

_What is OpenSocial?_

_What is HTML5?_

_What is CMIS?_

All of the above technologies are open standards developed by different standards bodies. Most importantly, all of these standards are being used in some way by various ICS products. The questions you should be asking as customers and/or business partners is&#8230;

> Why do I care about them? Why should I take time out of my day to learn more about them? Why should I integrate them into my applications?

I am sure some people inside the Lotus community can answer all of the above questions. Even if you don&#8217;t know what any of the above are, or you only know a few, that is not really that important. What is important, is why these technologies are important to the products we all know and love. If you don&#8217;t know why any of these technologies are important to IBM and Lotus than we (IBM) are failing to communicate the importance of open standards to our customers and business partners. I don&#8217;t think it is because we haven&#8217;t talked about them, because we have. They have been mentioned numerous times over the past 2 years at several conferences, including the OGS at Lotusphere. I think we may be doing a poor job at giving meaningful use cases for using these technologies.

I would like to hear the community&#8217;s thoughts on how ICS is promoting open standards. Do you think we are doing a good job? Do you think we need to be doing a better job evangelizing these standards?
