The replay of the IBM Pulse 2014 OGS is now available for you to watch if you missed it live yesterday.  One of the key announcements from yesterdays OGS was the introduction of [Codename: BlueMix](http://ryanjbaxter.com/2014/02/24/what-is-codename-bluemix/ "What Is Codename: BlueMix?").  The entire OGS is worth watching but if you are interested in the BlueMix announcement go to minute 38 in the video.
