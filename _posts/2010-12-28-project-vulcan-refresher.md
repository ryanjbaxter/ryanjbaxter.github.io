With Lotusphere coming up in about a month now, Project Vulcan will surely be a hot topic again this year.  There is at least one <a href="https://www-950.ibm.com/events/wwe/lotus/lsph2011.nsf/sessionabstract?openform&sessionid=INV104" target="_blank">session</a> dedicated to Project Vulcan.  If you need to refresh your memory on what Project Vulcan REALLY is, than I sugest you watch this <a href="http://www.viddler.com/explore/dominopoint/videos/24/2187.075/" target="_blank">video</a>.  I would be interested in hearing if there are topics related to Project Vulcan that you are interested in learning more about or that you may be unclear on an want a better explanation.  As always leave comments below.
