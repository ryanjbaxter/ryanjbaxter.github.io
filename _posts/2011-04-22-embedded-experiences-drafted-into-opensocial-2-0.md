Yesterday a patch I wrote for embedded experiences was applied to the draft version of the OpenSocial 2.0 spec.  If you recall from my previous posts, [here](http://ryanjbaxter.com/2011/04/13/ibms-proposals-for-opensocial-2-0/ "IBM’s Proposals For OpenSocial 2.0") and [here](http://ryanjbaxter.com/2011/02/04/open-standards-ibm-social-business-toolkit-and-embedded-experiences/ "Open Standards, IBM Social Business Toolkit, and Embedded Experiences"), embedded experiences is going to be a huge part of future products at IBM.  However by making it part of the OpenSocial spec we are trying to spread adoption of this technology outside IBM as well.  Any software that has email or an activity stream could take avantage of embedded experiences if they wanted.  You could imagine for example embedded experiences in GMail or Twitter.  Anyways if your interested you can check out the draft <a href="http://opensocial-resources.googlecode.com/svn/spec/2.0/Core-Gadget.xml#Embedded-Experiences" target="_blank">here</a>.  Next step is to add a reference implementation to Shindig, so everyone can start playing with some real code, look for that soon.
