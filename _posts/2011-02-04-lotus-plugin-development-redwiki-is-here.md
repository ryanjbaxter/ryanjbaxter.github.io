I just noticed the <a href="http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/ddwiki.nsf/xpViewCategories.xsp?lookupName=Redbooks%20Wiki%3A%20Creating%20Plugins%20for%20Lotus%20Notes%2C%20Sametime%2C%20and%20Symphony" target="_blank">RedWiki for plugin development</a> was posted on the Notes Domino AppDev wiki!  This is an essential resource for plugin developers looking to integrate into Lotus Notes, Sametime, Symphony, and Expeditor.  It was written by people both inside and outside IBM and has a ton of content in it.  It&#8217;s a great getting started resource and includes everything from setting up your development environment to creating complex context menus.  Check it out!
