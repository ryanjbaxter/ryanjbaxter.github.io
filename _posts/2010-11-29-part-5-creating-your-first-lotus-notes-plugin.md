In part 5 of this tutorial I show you how to create an NSF update site and create a widget which uses this update.  I then show you how to create a widget catalog and how to add the widget to the catalog so you can share it with others.  This concludes my tutorial on how to create your first Lotus Notes plugin.  I showed you from start to finish how you can begin exploring plugin development within Lotus Notes.  If you would like to see more videos like this please let me know what other topics you would like me to cover.
