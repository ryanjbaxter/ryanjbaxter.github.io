One of the more common questions I get about using Bluemix is &#8220;How do I use my own domain names for my apps in Bluemix?&#8221;.  Bluemix allows you to bind multiple routes to any given application so in addition to the mybluemix.net route your application has you can bind any number of other routes as well whether they use the mybluemix.net domain name or your own domain name.  Here is a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG7UbOHywXc" target="_blank">video</a> of how you can use your own domain names in your application routes.
