Since my last post about Lotusphere 2012, I have had a few changes in my schedule.

First I will be co-hosting a BOF on OpenSocial, Activity Streams and any other open standard related to social business.  The BOF is on Wednesday January 18th at 7AM.  There will be a number of experts on OpenSocial and Activity Streams on hand to answer your questions and discuss anything you would like.

Second, I will be speaking about OpenSocial to some of the students who will be attending Lotusphere this year.  I am not sure how much they will actually even know about OpenSocial or what IBM uses it for but I hope to teach them a thing or two and peak their interest a bit.  Also I am not sure if, other Lotusphere/Connect attendees can attend or if it is just the students&#8230;

Lastly I got my lab schedule for the week.  Below are the details on when I will be in the lab.  My Monday schedule may change because that is the day I am speaking to the students..

Monday 12:30-4:00

Tuesday 3:00-5:00

Wednesday 10:00-12:30 and 1:30-4:30

Thursday 9:00 &#8211; 11:00
