Earlier this week I posted a blog about what I will be showing at IBM Connect.  Earlier this week we updated the IBM SBT Playground on <a href="https://greenhouse.lotus.com/sbt/SBTPlayground.nsf/Home.xsp" target="_blank">Greenhouse</a> which includes the new OpenSocial functionality I talked about in my <a title="IBM Connect 2014 Preview" href="http://ryanjbaxter.com/2014/01/20/ibm-connect-2014-preview/" target="_blank">blog post</a> and demos at my Jumpstart on Sunday.  In addition we published a <a href="http://www.openntf.org/main.nsf/project.xsp?r=project/Social%20Business%20Toolkit%20SDK/releases/7C7EECB47BDB969586257C6700358900" target="_blank">release</a> of the SDK which includes a new version of the <a href="https://github.com/OpenNTF/SocialSDK/tree/master/samples/domino/nsf/playground" target="_blank">NSF for the Playground</a> and the OSGi bundles for allowing you to render gadgets within your own XPages apps.  There is a sample of how to do this in the <a href="https://github.com/OpenNTF/SocialSDK/tree/master/samples/domino/nsf/socialenabler" target="_blank">SBT Sample App</a> which shows you a very basic example of how you can render gadgets in your app.  If you want to learn more check out this <a href="https://github.com/OpenNTF/SocialSDK/wiki/Building-Your-Own-OpenSocial-Container" target="_blank">wiki page</a>.
