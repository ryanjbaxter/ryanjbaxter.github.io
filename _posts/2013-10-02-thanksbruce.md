Today I would like to say thank you to the one and only Bruce Elgort.  He is a true thought leader and advocate of all things technology.  Obviously Bruce&#8217;s greatest contribution to the IBM community has been his work as chairman of OpenNTF.  I am sure everyone knows that OpenNTF wouldn&#8217;t be what it is today without Bruce&#8217;s involvement.  For me personally, Bruce has always been there to give honest feedback about the features and products I work on as an IBMer.  I trust his opinion and appreciate his honesty and he always provides me with great perspectives on the things I work on.  So #thanksbruce for all that you have done with OpenNTF and all you continue to do for everyone in the community!
