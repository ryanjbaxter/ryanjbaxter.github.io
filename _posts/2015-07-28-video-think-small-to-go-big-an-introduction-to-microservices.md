Back in March of this year I gave a session at <a href="https://www.devnexus.com/s/index" target="_blank">DevNexus</a> called _<a href="https://www.devnexus.com/s/devnexus2015/speakers#Ryan_Baxter" target="_blank">Think Small To Go Big &#8211; An Introduction To Microservices</a>._  Today DevNexus posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssxgX27LGlE" target="_blank">the video</a> of the session I gave.  You can watch it below.  It is actually a great compliment to the past three blog posts I have written on <a href="http://ryanjbaxter.com/2015/07/13/building-cloud-native-applications/" target="_blank">Cloud Native apps</a> and Microservices (<a href="http://ryanjbaxter.com/2015/07/15/using-microservices-to-build-cloud-native-applications-part-1/" target="_blank">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://ryanjbaxter.com/2015/07/22/using-microservices-to-build-cloud-native-applications-part-2/" target="_blank">Part 2</a>).  This video actually includes a live demos of the application I referenced in my blog posts.  So if you want to see some of the benefits I talked about in my blog posts in action you should definitely check out the video.
