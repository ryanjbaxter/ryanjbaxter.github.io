A few weeks ago we moved the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2014/10/22/internet-of-things-foundation/" target="_blank">Internet of Things service out of beta</a> indicating it was ready for prime time.  This was exciting news except for the fact that it introduced some breaking changes, code written against the beta IoT service would most likely <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/iot/2014/10/22/changes-iot-foundation-migrating-old-applications/" target="_blank">not work with the new service</a>.  This included code I had written a <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2014/07/16/bluemix-internet-things/" target="_blank">few months ago</a> to demonstrate the beta IoT service.  I finally had some time to go back and update this code so it works with the new IoT service.  The new code is now available in the <a href="https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/iot-sensor-tag" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>.  In addition to updating the code I thought I would create an updated video of how to use the IoT service.  Check it out below!
