If you were not able to attend yesterday&#8217;s BlueMix Virtual Meetup, the replay is now available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVydCnZ4E0o" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.  Thankfully the demo gods were with me yesterday and I was able to successfully complete a live demo of adding a service, updating the code, and pushing back to BlueMix!  Unfortunately the audio was a little choppy at points, not sure why.  I will probably give Hangouts one more shot, maybe it was a one time thing but if it happens again I will look into other ways of hosting the virtual meetup.

If you are looking for the slides you can find them on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/RyanBaxter/dev-nirvanabluemix" target="_blank">SlideShare</a>.

If you are looking for the code from the demo you can find it on <a href="https://github.com/CodenameBlueMix/session-questions" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.  I need to do some cleanup with the code and the documentation so please be patient.

For those that attended the meetup, thank you very much!
