This year at IBM Interconnect I did my first Ignite talk.  If you are not familiar with what an Ignite talk is, check out this video on how to give one.

The basic idea is that you have 5 minutes and 20 slides to talk about your topic.  The slides advance every 15 seconds, so that makes things a little more interesting but helps you stay on point <img src="http://ryanjbaxter.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

My Ignite talk was titled &#8220;Release Your Inner Developer Advocate&#8221; and focused on why every developer should be a developer advocate.  You can check out my Ignite talk, and all the others from the Wednesday night reception below.  Mine starts at minute 16.
