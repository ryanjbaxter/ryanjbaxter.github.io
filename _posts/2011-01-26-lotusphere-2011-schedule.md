Well it&#8217;s been a while since I have blogged, mostly because work has been busy and I have been getting things ready for LS.  However I thought it would be useful to let everyone know what my schedule will be for Lotusphere 2011 and where people can find me.  The most useful part of this for everyone is probably be my schedule for the meet the developers lab.  I know sometimes people stop by the lab looking for someone just to find out they are not there so hopefully this will help anyone who is looking for me  <img src="http://ryanjbaxter.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I encourage everyone to stop by the labs in Asia1 and Asia2 to talk the developers of the products you all know and love.  It maybe the only time this year you get to talk to us face to face.  Please bring questions, compliments, complaints, or anything else.  This is your opportunity to influence the products you use everyday.  Since Tungle is the office scheduling app of Lotusphere 2011 I put everything on my Tungle calendar.  Check it out.   <a href="http://tungle.me/ryanjbaxter" target="_blank">http://tungle.me/ryanjbaxter </a>
