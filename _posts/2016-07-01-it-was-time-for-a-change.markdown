Change is good...well thats what they say anyways ;)  After working for IBM for 8+ years, I have left the only company I have every worked for and have joined Pivotal.  I owe a lot to IBM.  I joined right out of college and I learnt so much during the 8 years I was there.  I worked on a lot of great projects, and was presented with so many great opportunities that took my career in directions I would have never imagined.  By far the part of IBM that has impacted me the most both personally and professionally were the people.  There are SO many talented people at IBM, and I was lucky to work with many of them.  They taught me how to be an engineer, how to survive in a company with 400k people, and what it takes to progress professionally.

Recently however an opportunity came up for me to join Pivotal and work on the Spring Cloud team.  If you are a regular reader of this blog, you have probably noticed that I have been a big fan of Spring and Spring Cloud, so when the opportunity to work on those technologies presented itself I could not pass it up.

I am truly thankful for my 8+ years at IBM, and I am very excited to now be starting a new chapter in my career with Pivotal.
