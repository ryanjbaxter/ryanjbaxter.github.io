This year at [DevNexus](https://devnexus.com/s/index) I gave a presentation
showing how you can use the IBM IoT Foundation and an Apple Watch to control
a drone.  The presentation was very well received at the conference and I had
a lot of good feedback from attendees.  If you are interested in checking out the
session the recording is on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEz3Oaj-cRg), or
if you prefer, you can just watch the video below.
