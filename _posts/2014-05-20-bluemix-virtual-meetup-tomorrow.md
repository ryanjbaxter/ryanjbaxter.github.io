We are now about 24 hours away from tomorrows BlueMix Virtual Meetup.  This being our first meetup, the content will mainly be introductory and if the demo gods are with us we should have some live demos as well (with real live coding!!!).  I had some trouble using Google+ events, I did not realize that an On Air Event is different than a normal event with a hangout.  Oh well, it shouldn&#8217;t cause too much confusion.  You can find the on air broadcast event <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cha12oeo9f1bcntafpdrcmi2ufg" target="_blank">here</a>, or if you prefer you can go directly to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVydCnZ4E0o" target="_blank">YouTube page</a> here.  This is all linked to from the original <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cndiobcva25gl1th5qr7i3jf12g" target="_blank">Google+ event</a> as well.  If you want you can also come back to this blog post to view the live broadcast using the YouTube video below.  Look forward to seeing everyone tomorrow at 10 AM EST!
