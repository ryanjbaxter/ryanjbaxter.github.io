Last month I gave a talk on deploying Docker containers to the cloud at QCon San Francisco.  In this talk I cover some of the challenges you face deploying Docker containers in a production environment and how using a cloud solution like Bluemix can eliminate those challenges.  I walk through some of the key benefits of using Docker on Bluemix and then dive into a demo showing how some of the features work.  Below is the replay of my session.  Enjoy!
