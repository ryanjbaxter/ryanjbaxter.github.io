I am heading out to Boulder Colorado to a small conference called <a href="http://boulderux.com/" target="_blank">BoulderUX</a>. I am going to be speaking about OpenSocial and <a href="http://opensocial-resources.googlecode.com/svn/spec/trunk/Core-Gadget.xml#Embedded-Experiences" target="_blank">embedded experiences</a>. I am trying to get more and more companies not only interested in OpenSocial but start thinking about how they can use gadgets such as embedded experiences to enrich their end user&#8217;s experience.  We will be covering the anatomy of the gadget XML, what an embedded experience is, how to use the <a href="http://sandbox.opensocial2.org:8080/collabapp/index.html" target="_blank">OpenSocial 2.0 Sandbox</a>, and finally my college Stanton will be doing a live coding session.  The sides we will be using at the conference are posted up on <a href=" http://www.slideshare.net/ryanjbaxter/hands-on-with-opensocial-and-embedded-experiences-9196859" target="_blank">slideshare</a>.  Also if you are interested in the code we will be referencing it can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/cb936123966efa6abbae" target="_blank">here.</a>
