We are now a week away from [next weeks](http://ryanjbaxter.com/2014/04/22/bluemix-virtual-meetup-may-21st/ "BlueMix Virtual Meetup – May 21st") virtual BlueMix Meetup.  Next weeks event will be mostly technical and targeting developers looking to get started building apps with BlueMix.  We will cover the a wide range of topics in enough detail that you should feel confident enough to push your first app after we are done.   If you can&#8217;t make it, there will a recording of the meetup that will be available after the meetup is over.  I will also make the slides available on SlideShare.  I look forward to talking to everyone next week!
