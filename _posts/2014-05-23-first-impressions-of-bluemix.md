Over the past few months IBM has been holding what it calls &#8220;<a href="http://www-304.ibm.com/events/idr/idrevents/detail.action?meid=16628&ca=dwhome" target="_blank">200 Days Of BlueMix</a>&#8220;.  These are essentially workshops where IBM introduces users to BlueMix and gives them the opportunity to work side by side with IBM engineers to get started building apps on the platform.  There have been a couple of videos that have come out of these events with some users sharing their initial thoughts about BlueMix and how they think it can help them change the way they are building applications.  If you are wondering what some actual users are saying take a listen!
