A few weeks ago I wrote a [blog post](http://ryanjbaxter.com/2014/04/22/bluechatter-a-sample-app-for-bluemix/ "BlueChatter: A Sample App For BlueMix") on a sample app I built in Node.js called BlueChatter.  At a high level the app is an IRC or chat like client.  However, that is not the main purpose of the app.  The real purpose of the app is to show how you can write apps that are scalable in BlueMix.  I have also now detailed the process of how I constructed this application in an <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-bluemix-node-redis/index.html" target="_blank">article on developerWorks</a>.  It takes you through writing the initial implementation, deploying it to BlueMix, and then changing the implementation so the app can scale in the cloud.  It is certainly a very detailed tutorial, so if you decide to follow along I would set aside some time to do it.  Even if you don&#8217;t follow along, reading through the tutorial should give you idea of how to build scalable applications for BlueMix.  Enjoy!
