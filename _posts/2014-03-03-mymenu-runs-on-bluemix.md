MyMenu won the [app dev throwdown](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/industry-solution-partners/entry/mymenu_wins_the_ibm_pulse_app_throwdown?lang=en) held at IBM Pulse last week.  They created an app that incorporated mobile and analytics and runs on BlueMix and Softlayer.  Here is the marketing video they put together describing the app and how they built it.
