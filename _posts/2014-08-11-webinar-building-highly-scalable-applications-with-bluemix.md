The elasticity of the cloud is a huge selling point for most developers when considering where to deploy their applications.  The ability to add and remove instances of your application based on the load against it saves you a lot of time and money.  However you can&#8217;t just deploy any application to the cloud and expect it will behave properly when scaled horizontally.  In fact, if you didn&#8217;t think about scalability when building your application chances are your application will break when scaled.

Luckily if you keep scalability in mind when building your application there are a number of patterns you can use to make sure your application will scale flawlessly in the cloud.  On August 19th I will be hosting a webinar going over many of these patterns and how you can use them when building your next cloud application.  You can register for the webinar <a href="http://ibm.biz/ScalableApps-Blog" target="_blank">here</a>, and join your fellow developers on August 19th to learn how to build applications that scale.
