Recently I have been looking into the functionality of MIME emails in Notes.  For those of you who are unfamiliar with the tearm <a title="MIME" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME" target="_blank">MIME</a>, it basically refers to emails from people who do not use Notes as their email client.  For example, if someone who uses GMail sends and email to a Notes user, that email is a MIME email.  I am wondering if Notes users have complaints or would like to see improvements in how Notes handles these emails.  If you do have comments, good or bad, please leave a comment below.
