The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7yby_IJqgY" target="_blank">video for the Lotusphere 2012 Social App Throwdown</a> was finally posted today.  All the applications demoed in this video were build using OpenSocial and ran inside of email in Notes and Domino Social Edition as well as Connections Next.  For more information on embedded experiences and OpenSocial, [see my previous blog post.](http://ryanjbaxter.com/2012/01/25/thoughts-on-lotusphere-2012/ "Thoughts On Lotusphere 2012")  This video is a great example of the power of OpenSocial and gives you some good use cases for how you can leverage OpenSocial from your existing apps.  Feel free to contact me if you want more information.
