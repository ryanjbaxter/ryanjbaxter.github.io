You may have noticed the JazzHub DevOps service in the BlueMix catalog as you have been poking around.  If you have not played around with it yet I suggest you get to it!

> IBM DevOps Services is a place where you can collaborate with others to develop, track, plan and deploy software.

Using the <a href="https://hub.jazz.net/tutorials/jazzeditor" target="_blank">auto-deploy feature in JazzHub</a> you can easily deploy your project to BlueMix on every commit, in other words it allows you to practice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration" target="_blank">continuous integration</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery" target="_blank">delivery</a>.  It takes about 1 minute to enable once you have your project created.  Below is a video demonstrating how to use JazzHub to deploy your app to the cloud using BlueMix.  As I mention in this video, it is very important that you have a manifest.yml file for your project.  More information about how to construct and use manifests can be found in the <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html" target="_blank">Cloud Foundry documentation</a>.
