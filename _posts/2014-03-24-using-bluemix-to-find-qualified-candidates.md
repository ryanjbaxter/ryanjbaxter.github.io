My colleague David Barnes has created a new video demonstrating BlueMix.  In this video he walks through a scenario where an HR departments wants to build an app to help find candidates for a job using LinkedIn.  Check it out below.  If you want to know some of the nitty gritty details about how deploying an app works check out my [blog post](http://ryanjbaxter.com/2014/03/24/pushing-a-java-app-to-bluemix/ "Pushing A Java App To BlueMix") on how to deploy a Java app to BlueMix.
