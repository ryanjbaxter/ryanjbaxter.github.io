Over the weekend there were two questions posted to the BlueMix forum about using custom domains with apps deployed to BlueMix.  (Both questions were posted by the same person.)  Excellent question!  In fact it is pretty easy to do, it basically involves telling BlueMix about your domain name and then creating a CNAME record pointing towards app.ng.bluemix.net.  See the answers to the forum questions for the details.
