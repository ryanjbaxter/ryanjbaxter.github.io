I have received a lot of requests to record a video demoing the application Stanton Sievers and myself built for our Show N Tell session at Lotusphere 2012.  It has taken me a while, but I finally got around to recording a video of the demo.  (Recording videos always seem easy when you start out but they usually turn into quite the project.)  This video is not a recording of the entire Show N Tell session just a demo of the end application we built.  The video demos how you, as an application developer, can use embedded experiences to enhance the existing user experience and functionality of your applications.  In the video we act as an event organizer trying to get people to attend our event.  In this use case we use embedded experiences in emails and activity streams an leverage the social data (via the OpenSocial APIs) to spread word about the event we are organizing.  By leveraging the user&#8217;s activity stream and network contacts, we as the event organizar, can leverage the social network of the current user to attrack more attendees to our event.  Since it is likely that the person who registered for our event knows people who would be interested in similar topics we are likely to reach our target audience for the event, therefore increasing the likelyhood of other people registering.  This is a perfect example of how you can use the power of social to help achieve your business goals and help transform your applications into social business applications.
