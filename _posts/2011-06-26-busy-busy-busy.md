I have been MIA lately, for a number of reasons.  The biggest reason is because I recently got married on June 11th.  Preparing for that took up a lot of my spare time, although I must admit, my now wife did a majority of the hard work.  Then I took a 2 week vacation to Tahiti for our honeymoon.  (Tahiti is amazing by the way, if you ever get a chance to go I suggest you take it.)  At the same time leading up to the wedding work was getting really busy.  We are working very hard to build some very cool things for all our products.  Unfortunately our deadlines happened to coincide with my wedding and since I was driving some of these features I played a critical role in completing them.  Any spare time I had left over from planning our wedding, I spent working.  Now that the wedding and honeymoon is over I&#8217;m hoping I can get back to blogging and writing some more useful posts.  I already have some topics in mind that I would like to write about, and I think I might make another set of tutorials as well.  Looking forward to getting back into the swing of things!
