In a few weeks, on May 19th, the Apache Foundation will be hosting a <a href="http://events.apache.org/event/2013/barcamp-bos/index.html" target="_blank">BarCamp in Boston</a>.  The even will take place at Microsoft&#8217;s NERD Center in Cambridge.  Ultimately, as with all BarCamps the topics covered will be left up to the attendees, but we have some suggestions as well.

  * The Apache Way
  * The Apache Incubator
  * Learn how to get started contributing to an open source project
  * Apache Rave
  * Apache Shindig

Free food and swag will be provided, which is all made posible by our <a href="http://events.apache.org/event/2013/barcamp-bos/sponsors.html" target="_blank">sponsors</a>.  Please join us for what is sure to be a great event.
