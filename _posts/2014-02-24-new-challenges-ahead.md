Check out my [blog post](http://ryanjbaxter.com/2014/02/24/what-is-codename-bluemix/ "What Is Codename: BlueMix?") about BlueMix.

With that said it was a tough decision to leave ICS.  I have made a number of good friends both inside and outside of IBM.  The ICS community has been great to me, and I have learned so much from everyone.  I think there are great things ahead for the ICS community and products, and I can&#8217;t wait to see how things play out over the coming months.  I won&#8217;t completely out of the ICS picture though, I already have some ideas of how the technology ICS offers can intersect with BlueMix, hopefully I can put something together for a nice session at Connect 2015!
