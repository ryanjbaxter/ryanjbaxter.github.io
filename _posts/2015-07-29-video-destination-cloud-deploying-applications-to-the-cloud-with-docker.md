Back in June I gave a session on Docker at <a href="http://www.devoxx.co.uk/" target="_blank">Devoxx UK</a> called _<a href="http://cfp.devoxx.co.uk/2015/talk/JIP-9528/Destination:_Cloud._Deploying_Applications_To_The_Cloud_With_Docker_" target="_blank">Destination: Cloud. Deploying Applications To The Cloud With Docker</a>_.  Today Devoxx released the recording of my session on Parleys, you can view the video <a href="https://www.parleys.com/tutorial/destination-cloud-deploying-applications-cloud-docker" target="_blank">here</a>.  Unfortunately you can only watch the first 5 minutes of the video with out registering for an account.  The good news if that you can register for an account very easily and for free.  This recording is a great compliment to a blog post I wrote a few weeks ago on the <a href="http://ryanjbaxter.com/2015/07/06/an-introduction-to-the-new-ibm-containers-service/" target="_blank">IBM Container service</a>.  When I gave the session the IBM Container service in Bluemix was still in beta, but all of the content still applies to the service today so check it out!.
