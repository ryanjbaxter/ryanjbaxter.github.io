Today one of my colleagues and lead for Widgets and LiveText in Notes and iNotes, Doug MacDonald, posted a set of  <a href="http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Tutorial_Videos_on_How_to_Create_Widgets_and_Live_Text_Actions" target="_blank">videos</a> on how to use and create all different kinds of Widgets and LiveText recognizers.  It is the most comprehensive overview of Widgets and LiveText I have ever seen and the videos provide great demonstrations on anything you have ever wanted to to with these features.  The wiki article speaks for itself so there is not much more to say here.  Also be sure to check out this <a href="http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/dominowiki.nsf/dx/Video_Demonstration_of_Widgets_and_Live_Text_in_IBM_Notes_9.0_and_IBM_iNotes_9.0" target="_blank">video</a> of the new Widgets and LiveText features in IBM Notes and iNotes 9.0.
