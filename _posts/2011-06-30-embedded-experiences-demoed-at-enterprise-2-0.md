While  I was on vacation, Enterprise 2.0 took place in Boston Ma.  Since I was out of town one of my colleages, Andrew Davis (IBM), went to represent OpenSocial at the conference.  He was demoing the OpenSocial 2.0 Sandbox which we have been working on for the OpenSocial Foundation.  David Berlind from InformationWeek did a short interview with Andrew at Enterprise 2.0 where he demoed Embedded Experiences in the OpenSocial 2.0 Sandbox.  Remember embedded experiences is one of the new features being released in OpenSocial 2.0 and IBM has been driving this feature in the specification.  The interview went really well, except for the mention of Outlook and Exchange.  Check out the video, and don&#8217;t forget you can play in the <a title="OpenSocial 2.0 Sandbox" href="http://sandbox.opensocial2.org:8080/collabapp/index.html" target="_blank">sandbox</a> as well.
