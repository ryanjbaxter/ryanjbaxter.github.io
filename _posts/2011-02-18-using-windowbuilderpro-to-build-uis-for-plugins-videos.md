At Lotusphere 2011 Mikkel and I demoed a plugin for Eclipse called <a href="http://code.google.com/javadevtools/wbpro/features/swt/data_binding/index.html" target="_blank">WindowBuilder Pro</a> in our plugin development jumpstart.  I figured I would create some short videos on how to install the plugins into Eclipse and how you can use them to build UIs for your plugins.  The videos are pretty simple and strait forward.  They don&#8217;t go into too much details on all the things you can do, but it should be enough to get you started.  I encourage everyone to go to the WindowBuilder Pro web site and check out some of the tutorials up there.
